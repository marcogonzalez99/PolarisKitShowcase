# 🎮 PolarisKit

PolarisKit is a modular starter kit for building 2D games with Pygame, designed to help developers get from idea to gameplay fast.

It includes:

- ✅ Scene management system (Title, Game, Pause)
- 🎛️ Global pause functionality (ESC key)
- 🎨 Asset loading for images, sounds, and fonts
- 🧩 Scalable, clean folder layout
- 🐛 Debug overlay (toggle with TAB)

## 💡 Why PolarisKit?

Pygame is an amazing library, but structuring your project can be a challenge. PolarisKit gives you a lightweight but solid foundation so you can focus on *your* game mechanics instead of boilerplate.
